## Machine Learning & AI - Spring 2019

### Week 06

Announcements and general information is available through the [Moodle flow](https://cphbusiness.mrooms.net/enrol/index.php?id=3151). 

----------------

### Focus this week

- **Create a Common Platform(!):** We have decided that we continue the course work using VirtualBox+Ubuntu18 desktop. That way we be sure to be on the same page. You can find instructions on how to install that platform [here](https://github.com/datsoftlyngby/soft2019spring-ai/blob/master/Notes/Instructs_MLAI_VB_Ubuntu18.txt). 

- **Topics** 
  - Python in Jupyter notebooks + Python libraries
  - The machine learning wheel again
  - Classes of machine learning
  - Choose an ML class for your task, mapping it out
  - Thinking of data
  - Linear regression 
  - Binary classification
  - Exercises

-----------------

### Classroom Activities 

- Infrastructure, is everyone up-tro-speed? Checking up on:
  * **Python** devel environment,
  * **Jupyter Notebooks** working installation,
  * **Github** access and usage,
  * **Peergrade** access and usage.
 
- Mentimeter (instructions will be given in class):
  - Are we close to (but not in!) our comfort zone? 
  - Instructions on how to join the poll will be given in class.

- Student Q & A session on the 1st exercises and general introduction, to make sure we're all clear on how to progress.
- We will loosely review the exercises and code from last week, by peer presentation and discussion, to see how far we could get during the Introduction week.
- Lecture introdcution to topics
- Classroom Exercises
- Homework (if time runs out)

**Estimated need for activity out side classroom:** Some 6 hours outside class, including reading -- remember that the book is only 100 pages, but very densly written! The concepts of the ML process and various calsses of learning (supervised, un-supervised, etc.) should be fairly well established by Week 6.

-----------------
### Resources

**Reading:** For this week, you should read Chapters 1 & 2 of the '100 Page ML Book'. We will begin to look at some simple examples of supervised learning which means moving (slowly) into chapter 3 (but don't read that just yet).

**Lecture Slides:** coming soon ...

**Code:** you should do exercises and **code with your group, preferably from scratch**, though, some assistance is available through central online resources.

- [Hands-on-ml2 notebooks:](https://github.com/ageron/handson-ml2) Jupyter notebooks with great Pythonic code examples.
- [Python core library](https://docs.python.org/3/)
- [Nympy:](https://www.numpy.org/devdocs/reference/) for numeric calculations and manipulations.
  - [Tutorials](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/user/quickstart.html)
- [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/users/index.html) for plotting and visualizing solutions and data.
  - [Gallery](https://matplotlib.org/gallery/index.html)
- [Scikit-learn:](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) for doing ML and scintific calculations on N-dimensional data.
  - [Docs](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/documentation.html)
- [Scikit-image:](https://scikit-image.org) powerful vizualization tools and graphics manipulation, suited for ML/AI. 
  - [Docs](http://scikit-image.org/docs/stable/)
  - [Gallery](http://scikit-image.org/docs/stable/auto_examples/index.html)
- [Keras:](https://keras.io) and [Tensorflow:](https://www.tensorflow.org)

**Classroom exercises:** TBD (to-be-determined) -- but will be taken in context of the chapter 1 and 2 of the reading material, i.e. the '100 Page ML Book' and the supplmentary online resources for the book ['Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn & Tensorflow'](https://github.com/ageron/handson-ml2).

**Workshop Hours:** we will settle for a weekly time slot, when I will be stationed in a room/office space on the CPHBUS campus, so that we might get a chance to look over the things that you (or I) are wondering about. It will be announced on the Moodle Flow ASAP, after we've made a decision during class this week (week 6) over Mentimeter.
